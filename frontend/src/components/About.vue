    <h1>THE SLEEVE KINGS DIFFERENCE</h1>
    <div class="lol"></div>
    <p>
      We are a small group of dedicated board gamers who happen to be passionate
      about one thing: Card Sleeves. Yes there are tons of card sleeve options
      out there but we wanted to create something new, a high-quality "standard"
      sleeve that was better than any other yet affordable. We have been
      involved to some degree in sleeves for over 8 years and bring a unique
      know-how to this business. Seth is the founder of Mayday Games, an
      established player in the board game and card sleeve space, and Jason is
      the brain child behind much of our sleeve development. He handles the
      day-to-day factory operations. Sleeve Kings is an all new kind of sleeve
      made in a different factory than Mayday and with a different process and
      different specifications, which is why a different company exists. We are
      excited to bring these sleeves to the world!
    </p>

    <p>
      So how are Sleeve Kings' sleeves different from the rest?
      <em>Thicker Than Any Other "Standard" Sleeves</em> -Most "Standard"
      Sleeves are 40 microns thick, a few are even 50 microns.
      <em>Ours are 60 microns thick!</em> That is 50% more than most!
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>10% More Sleeves Than The Other Guys</em> -Standard sleeves come
      100/pack. We are the only brand offering 110 per pack! 10% more in every
      pack!
    </p>
    <p>
      The <em>"Clear" Winner</em> -Our sleeves are made from Cleartechâ„¢
      Polypropylene. Our sleeves are made from 60 micron thick sheets which are
      demonstrably clearer than the other guys. You can actually SEE the
      difference. Just as diamonds are rated on a clarity scale, even 100%
      polypropylene can vary significantly from product to product depending on
      how it is manufactured. <em>You will see the difference!</em>
